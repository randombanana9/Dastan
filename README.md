# Dastan
 This is a project to create a GUI in python for playing the game Dastan.
 Dastan is a game created by AQA for the 2023 A-Level Computer Science skeleton code.
 
 Though initially, this project only aims to recreate the game with a GUI, it may later also change some rules about the game in order to fix certain gameplay issues which weren't considered in the scope of creating an A-Level examination.
